    <p>GitHub Actions is a platform built into GitHub that lets you automate software workflows directly from your code repositories. 
      A workflow is an automated process. Weâ€™ll use workflows to model the commit stage of our deployment pipeline. Each workflow 
      listens to specific events that trigger its execution. Workflows should be defined in a .github/workflows folder in a GitHub 
      repository root, and they should be described following the YAML format provided by GitHub Actions. In your Catalog Service project 
      (catalog- service), create a main.yml file under a new .github/workflows folder. This workflow will be triggered whenever new code 
      is pushed to the repository. </p>
